# flower-growth
A visual design tool that creates an environment in which users grow flowers and maintain a healthy garden.

User controls:
- LEFT mouse button: plants a seed
- RIGHT mouse click on a seed: waters the seed
- SHIFT + LEFT mouse click on a flower: deletes the flower
- UP and DOWN arrow keys: switch between poppy and baby's breath flowers

Environment rules:
- there are 3 types of flowers: roses, poppies, baby's breath
- roses automatically grow in the environment
- poppy and baby's breath are planted by the user
- for each flower type, the more that there are, the more that the environment will reproduce
- if a poppy or baby's breath flower does not receive enough water, it will start to decay
- the more roses there are, the faster other types of flowers will decay
